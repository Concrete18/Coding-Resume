## Coding Languages

### Python

I fully started learning Python in March 2020. It has been my major focus and is used in the majority of my public and private projects.

### AHK

I started learning AHK for personal use around 2015.
I began learning AHK for speeding up common tasks that were often completed in a fraction of the time thanks to AHK.

## Projects

### [Auto Folder Cleaner](https://github.com/Concrete18/Auto-Folder-Cleaner)

This script searches a watched directory in order to move files based on their filetypes and keywords. It works by using For Loops to go through files in the watched directory. It checks for matches in a file type and keyword Dictionaries.

### [Weather Wallpaper Changer](https://github.com/Concrete18/Weather-Wallpaper-Changer)

This is a script that runs in the background setting wallpapers based on the time of day and weather forecast every 20 minutes. It uses Open Weather to check the sunset and sun rise times and weather. I convert the sunset and sunrise times using code to determine if it is currently sunset or sunrise, 20 minutes each, or if it is night or day.

### [Standing Reminder](https://github.com/Concrete18/Standing-Reminder)

This app allows you to set a reminder to stop using your computer after a configurable time period. It is intelligent enough to detect inactivity after the reminder has gone off allowing you to simply walk away for your chosen time. It will also reset the timer early if it detects inactivity past a configurable threshold. The timer will also reset upon detecting a time gap in runs due to the computer going to sleep and then waking up a long enough time later.

### [Timed Sleep and Shutdown](https://github.com/Concrete18/Timed-Shutdown-Sleep)

Set a shutdown or sleep to a specific number of minutes away.

### [Credit Card Validator](https://github.com/Concrete18/Credit-Card-Validator)

Validates Entered Credit cards and tells you the provider of the card if it is Discover, Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
